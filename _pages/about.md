I’m currently a final year student at Bits Pilani – Goa Campus. I'm working as a research fellow at the University of Amsterdam for my bachelor thesis under the supervision of esteemed researcher Dr. Rajat Mani Thomas. Together we are trying to solve radiative transfer equation and simulate it using modern deep learning techniques.

From the very first year of my college life, I'm fascinated by Deep learning and I am looking to pursue a career in this domain. In my relatively young career, I have developed an interest in field of NLP and speech language processing. I am also interested in the domains of cognitive neuroscience and Human computer interaction. However, I don't want to limit myself to just these domains and I am open to explore other domains as well.
